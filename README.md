Hey, My name is Aryan Mishra. I am full stack web developper tranie at Acciojob.
i have been given a project to complete by Acciojob Name is SUDOKU-DSA game.

**ABOUT PROJECT**:

-> This is the introduction of project called Sudoku Solver.

-> The project is a game that allows the user to solve Sudoku puzzles.

-> The aim of the project is to recreate the experience of solving Sudoku puzzles that people used to do in newspapers.

**TECHNOLOGIES USED TO BUILD :**

-> The project will primarily use Java language for coding.

-> Java Swing have also used here to build the GUI of this game.

-> Java Swing is a part of JFC (Java Foundation Classes) which is used to create window-based applications.

-> i have used jFrame technolodgy here.

-> JFrames are top-level containers provided by Java Swing which provide a playground for designing components.
   JFrames are also known as base windows on which other components such as menu bars, panels, labels, text fields, buttons, etc. rely.
   Almost every Java Swing application starts with the JFrame window.
   
so here is the final project User Interface.
